  <h1><ins>Questions With Answer</ins></h1>

  <strong><big>Question 1</big></strong>
  <details>
    <summary>How often do you buy shoes?</summary>
    <p>I do not buy shoes regularly. The main reason behind this is that I am working in a field where I have to 
      continuously stand, and because of it, I like to wear comfortable footwear. So, I only buy shoes when I have to go on outings, 
      or I need a change or when I m going on a hike.</p>
  </details>

  <strong><big>Question 2</big></strong>
  <details>
    <summary>Do you like to wear shoes that are comfortable or good looking?</summary>
    <p>I like to wear comfortable shoes where I can feel relaxed. 
      Or else I check that if I am having any difficulties in walking and later, get hurt by it if itâ€™s uncomfortable. If I buy shoes just to look nice, it would mean that 
      I am just mimicking others, and I will only get myself into trouble later on.</p>
  </details>

  <strong><big>Question 3</big></strong>
  <details>
    <summary> Have you ever bought shoes online?</summary>
    <p>No, I have not bought shoes from online sites. There are many reasons for it.
       One reason cannot trust them the picture they show of the shoes, and the package which is received might be totally opposite. And, the reason will be the charges even they show us that there a sales is available they charge for 
      the delivery which I feel that costs more. And I want to check the material also.</p>

  <strong><big>Question 4</big></strong>
  <details>
    <summary> Do you know anyone who likes to buy many shoes?</summary>
    <p>Yes, my cousin brother. He is totally the opposite of me, where I don't trust 
      online shopping. He buys everything online. He loves to collect shoes of all the fashions. Be that sports shoes, casual shoes or others.
       He has a good taste and also likes to help others in buying that product.</p>
  </details>

  <strong><big>Question 5</big></strong>
  <details>
    <summary> What is your favourite type of shoes?</summary>
    <p>I love to wear casual shoes. Because it is comfortable and fashionable at the same
       time, I can wear it on any western dress. And,I can also give buy within my budget limit. Also, fashion is never outdated.</p>
  </details>

  <strong><big>Question 6</big></strong>
  <details>
    <summary> Are people willing to buy expensive shoes?</summary>
    <p>Yes, some are willing to buy expensive shoes just to follow the trend. 
      They do not check or think twice and pick that product to look super cool. However, there are also the brands to blame on because if their sales are high, they just think to make the price high too.
       And this can be the result also that people buy it because they have trust in them.</p>
  </details>

  <strong><big>Question 7</big></strong>
  <details>
    <summary> How often do you buy shoes?</summary>
    <p>I don't remember the last time I bought one. But in my closet, I have all brands
       from Gucci, Italian, Nike, all-stars, SGB, and others for showcasing to my friends. It feels 
      super dapper to be a shoe man with no cost of buying any as mostly gifted with it.</p>
  </details>

  <strong><big>Question 8</big></strong>
  <details>
    <summary> Are thong shoes OK for your feet?</summary>
    <p>Sometimes. The best flip-flops that have thicker soles, deeper heel cups and 
      support foot beds can be a good hot weather option. Wear them with caution, though. Walking long distances or fast paced can be dangerous.
       Many falls and broken toes occur with open-backed and open-toed shoes.</p>
  </details>

  <strong><big>Question 9</big></strong>
  <details>
    <summary> How do I pick running and walking shoes?</summary>
    <p>Comfort is key, and with so many different types and styles of running and walking shoes, it may be
       overwhelming to find the perfect pair for leisure or athletic training.</p>
  </details>

  <strong><big>Question 10</big></strong>
  <details>
    <summary> Is your body affected by the shoes you wear?</summary>
    <p>Yes, wearing heels shifts the center of your body mass toward the front of your
       body. This can add extra stress to your knee and hip joints in addition to the front of your feet.</p>
